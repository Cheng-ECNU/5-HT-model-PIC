Multiple patterns of persistent inward currents with manifold types of repetitive firing in medullar serotonergic neurons of mice: the experimental and modeling study

Upon running start.hoc, Click the pick a file button and pick 5HT_FI_base (current-clamp)or 5HT_IV_base (voltage-clamp). Then click the "Choose analysis" button and pick either FI for the current-clamp simulation or IV for the voltage-clamp simulation.
